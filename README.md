Railway monolithic repositry for vendure storefront and backend.
Storefront built off <a href="https://github.com/vendure-ecommerce/storefront-remix-starter/tree/master">Vendure Remix Storefront Starter</a>

# Backend
"npm install" to install dependencies
"npm run build" to build
"npm run dev" to run development server
Set .env to have URLs pointing to railway host

# Storefront
"yarn install" to install dependencies
Set .env variables especially VENDURE_API_URL to the SHOP API that you set in the local backend server
Both storefront and backend must be running simultaneously locally for this setup to work
"yarn dev" to run storefront locally
